        Welcome to the project! This website is the result of my graduation thesis and is dedicated to providing a 
        novel approach to product classification. I intend to accurately classify products based solely on their 
        product names by employing cutting-edge deep learning techniques. My ambition is to make product classification 
        simpler and more efficient for both businesses and individuals. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find our 
        website informative and useful in better categorizing products on e-commerce websites.
